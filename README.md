This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Modern Linux Tools containerization project that packages cutting-edge command-line tools into Docker containers for AlmaLinux 9 and CentOS 7. The project creates portable environments with modern alternatives to traditional Unix tools like `ripgrep` (rg), `bat`, `fd`, `fzf`, and many others.

The `setupMe.sh` script can also be used to serve Singularity Sandbox deployments (if deployed on CVMFS) as a virtual environment on host machines, making the tools accessible directly on the host system without containerization.

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **Dockerfiles**: Build containers with pre-installed modern tools
  - `alma9-linuxtools.Dockerfile` - Primary AlmaLinux 9 based container
  - `centos7-linuxtools.Dockerfile` - CentOS 7 based container
- **Setup Scripts**: Environment initialization and tool management
  - `setupMe.sh` - Main setup script for initializing the micromamba environment and tools
  - `entrypoint.sh` - Docker container entrypoint that sources setup scripts
  - `_activate_current_env.sh` - Micromamba environment activation helper
- **Tool Documentation**: 
  - `list-of-tools.md` - Comprehensive list of all included modern tools
  

### Package Management Strategy

The project uses **micromamba** as the primary package manager instead of traditional package managers. All tools are installed through conda-forge channels using micromamba, which provides:
- Fast, lightweight package management
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Easy environment isolation

### Tool Categories

Tools are organized into functional categories:
- **Search/Explorer**: ripgrep (rg), ugrep, fzf, skim, fd-find, broot
- **File Management**: yazi, lsd-rust, bat, glow-md, duf, dust, rip2
- **Process/System**: procs, btop, mcfly
- **Git Tools**: gh, git-delta, git-lfs, lazygit
- **Development**: rust, cargo, uv (Python), tealdeer (tldr)
- **AI Tools**: gemini-cli, claude-code, copilot-api, goose
- **Container Tools**: crane, dive
- **Utilities**: hyperfine, direnv, zellij

## Common Commands

### Building Containers
```bash
# Build AlmaLinux 9 container
docker build -f alma9-linuxtools.Dockerfile -t modern-linuxtools:alma9 .

# Build CentOS 7 container  
docker build -f centos7-linuxtools.Dockerfile -t modern-linuxtools:centos7 .
```

### Running Containers
```bash
# Run interactive container with tools activated
docker run -it modern-linuxtools:alma9

# Run with volume mount for persistent work
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/workspace modern-linuxtools:alma9
```

### Environment Management
```bash
# Source the setup script (automatically done in containers)
source setupMe.sh

# For Singularity/CVMFS deployments on host machines:
# Source setupMe.sh from the deployed path to activate tools in host environment
source /cvmfs/unpacked.cern.ch/registry.hub.docker.com/yesw2000/modern-linuxtools:alma9_x86-latest/setupMe.sh

# The Alma9 container is also compatible with CentOS7 hosts due to its reliance on glibc version 2.17.

# List all available tools with descriptions
list_tools

# Create new micromamba environment
mamba_new myenv

# Use git diff with delta highlighting
git_delta [git-diff-args]
```

### Tool Usage Examples
```bash
# Search files with ripgrep
rg "pattern" --type py

# Interactive file finder
fzf

# Modern ls replacement
lsd -la

# View files with syntax highlighting  
bat filename.py

# Process viewer
procs

# System monitor
btop

# Get quick help for any tool
tldr <command>
```

## Development Notes

- The setup script (`setupMe.sh`) handles architecture detection and micromamba initialization
- The script can be used both in Docker containers and as a virtual environment activator for Singularity/CVMFS deployments on host systems
- Tools are installed via micromamba to ensure consistent versions across environments
- The `git_delta` function wraps `git diff` with delta for enhanced output
- Cache directories are configured for optimal performance (tealdeer cache in CONDA_PREFIX)
- The entrypoint script enables bash with the setup script as rcfile for immediate tool availability

## File Modifications

When modifying setup scripts, ensure:
- Architecture compatibility checks remain in place
- Micromamba environment activation works correctly
- Tool aliases and functions are preserved
- Cache directory configurations are maintained
